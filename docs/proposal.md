## Underground Ordering
### Project Idea
My intention for this project is to create a way for people to order ahead of time at the underground. I would like to at minimum create an interface using items at the underground as an example of how this could be useful, as a proof of concept. This would be useful as some food such as the quesadillas can take 15 minutes to make. Being able to order ahead of time means students would less disruption to their workflow waiting around for food to be prepared. I would like to have the app communicate to a server to send the order to. And if I can get that to work, it would be good to have a chef's screen to recieve the orders. Another stretch goal would be to incorporate hanover outlook logins to prevent abuse.

### Main Features
#### 1. Order an item
   
      - a menu to select items from
   
      - ability to customize item's toppings
   
      - confirm and submit
   

#### Once that works, if I have time it would be nice to also impliment...

#### 2. A server
   
      - store orders

#### 3. Chef's screen
   
      - a way to view orders in progress (atleast for the chef)

#### 4. Other
      - login using hanover microsoft email
      - push notifications for customers to know when order is complete

### Comparable solution

#### [Chipotle](https://www.chipotle.com/)

Chipotle on android loads to a [welcome login screen](https://github.com/Hanover-CS/HC24-Luuk-Crawford-Senior-Project/assets/32851596/b88ffab7-d7fd-40e7-ab57-f08167a983dc). Though it can be skipped to view the menu and start to fill a cart after choosing a location.
I will make a landing screen that has a menu preview or a button to login to Hanover email through microsoft. The login will only be implimented if I happen to have extra time to figure out how that works.

Once login is confirmed, or if we pretend a login was confirmed the next page of actual ordering will show up.
