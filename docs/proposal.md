## Project Idea
My intention for this project is to create a way for people to order ahead of time at the underground. I would like to at minimum create an interface using items at the underground as an example of how this could be useful, as a proof of concept. I would like to have the app communicate to a server to send the order to. And if I can get that to work, it would be good to have a chef's screen to recieve the orders. Another stretch goal would be to incorporate hanover outlook logins to prevent abuse.
