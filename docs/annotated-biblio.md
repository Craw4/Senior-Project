### Example 1: [Wendy's](https://order.wendys.com/categories?site=menu&lang=en_US)

Wendy's is a popular fast food restaurant that has ordering online capabilities, ranging from ordering ahead of time for dine-in, takeout, or even delivery.
As seen below, the mobile browser and app look pretty much the same, with needing to click an item to customize and add to the cart. With the PC browser, you can click add to cart, and it will give the option between combo or single item.

[Wendy's browser][1] example:

Wendy's also has a version on the [Google Play][2] and [Apple's app store][3].

#### Thoughts:
  Wendy's layout is one way I could try and organize the app. Having the menu items in different slots would likely make it easier to make menu changes in the future. Having this much fancy-looking customization to orders and fancy looking interface is something I don't think I should aim for in this amount of time. I may make the menu a scroll of the options. Toppings and such can show up after selecting an item, similar to the app store image with checkboxes to optional toppings and such. Pictures would be nice, so I would add some temporary ones. I might prefer a smaller layout. It would be cool if I could just emulate the [current ordering sheets](https://github.com/Hanover-CS/HC24-Luuk-Crawford-Senior-Project/assets/32851596/19be7b5f-ed5d-42bb-882a-7042fcce4b22) into digital format since people are already familiar with those. 

### Example 2: [Chipotle](https://www.chipotle.com/) 

Chipotle is a good example because they have food similar to the underground such as their [quesadilla and burrito options, viewed from the mobile browser](https://github.com/Hanover-CS/HC24-Luuk-Crawford-Senior-Project/assets/32851596/353d2fc6-e825-4613-a81b-7232145e9a7b). For example, on the burrito up to 2 meats can be selected, and if 2 are selected they are [half portions visually](https://github.com/Hanover-CS/HC24-Luuk-Crawford-Senior-Project/assets/32851596/fbe3fa9d-8ac7-4149-b638-e803b37f4629). Chipotle apps available in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chipotle.ordering) and [Apple's app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chipotle-fresh-food-fast/id327228455).

#### Thoughts:
  I like the process of Chipotle's ordering more than Wendy's because instead of assuming what people want it requires the person to select what should be added to the order, the same way the [current ordering sheets](https://github.com/Hanover-CS/HC24-Luuk-Crawford-Senior-Project/assets/32851596/19be7b5f-ed5d-42bb-882a-7042fcce4b22) work. Though the current ordering sheets do not include the burrito because those you need to talk to the chef working there like subway.

### Example 3: [Taco Bell](https://www.tacobell.com/food)

Taco Bell also has a burritos and most orders are customizable. Items can be taken as is or customized to the customer's liking. Taco bell seems to have more customization than the other competitors. They let the customer choose how much of each ingredient and swap them with others. For example the [beef slot has 10 options](https://github.com/Hanover-CS/HC24-Luuk-Crawford-Senior-Project/assets/32851596/5be3b2bd-814c-4f92-b772-28643185b69c). They also inude the option to put some of the topping options on the side. App available in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tacobell.ordering&hl=en) and [Apple's app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taco-bell-fast-food-delivery/id497387361).


### Thoughts:
  There is a lot of customization that the underground doesn't currently offer. I don't expect to reach this level of customization because I don't think I'll have time to add a quantity or on the side option. Maybe I could have a spot for people to add a note on the order but that would make things more difficult than it already is.


## Language & technology options

### Web app development
Web app development would allow any web using device to use the app.

Downside is I would need to spend a lot more time to get started because I don’t have experience with this and would likely run into more issues starting from nothing. I would rather resume learning mobile app development than start something from scratch for a solo project.

### Multiplatform mobile development
Multiplatform development means code I make should work for multiple platforms. If I pursue mobile development, this means when I’m testing and working with an Android, it is coded in an environment that should also work with iOS devices. This makes supporting multiple platforms easier as I wouldn't need to learn and use two different languages at a time for iOS and Android. 

I intend to stick to mobile development for this project. Taking the multiplatform development path instead of web app means I have a better chance of getting this program work, and hopefully work on both android and iOS.

#### Kotlin
Kotlin is a multiplatform programming language that ["used by over 60% of professional Android developers"](https://developer.android.com/kotlin). And Kotlin has been [Google's top pick for Android development](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/18/five-years-later-google-is-still-all-in-on-kotlin/) as well. _____WIP

I have some familiarity with Kotlin as during May term I used Kotlin for my first android development. 

One downside to Kotlin is that multiplatform development for mobile is in beta which may come with some unexpected problems during development if I wanted to support iOS as well. It's noted as ["almost stable"](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.html) at the moment. This means I should be able to get it working on Android, and having it also work on iOS can work but may have some unexpected barriers. 

#### Java
Another option would be Java
