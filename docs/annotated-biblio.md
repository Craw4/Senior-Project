### Example 1: Wendy's

Wendy's is a popular fast food resturant that has ordering early capabilities. Ranging from ordering ahead of time for dine in, takeout, or even delivery.
As seen below, the mobile browser and app look pretty much the same with needing to click an item to customize and add to cart. The PC browser you can click add to cart and it will give the option between combo or single item.

Wendy's also has a version on the [android][2] and [apple][3] app store.

##### Thoughts:
  Wendy's layout is one way I could try and organize the app. Having the menu items in different slots would likely make it easier to make menu changes in the future.
